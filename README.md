# WhatsApp-Database-Reader
This python script reads Whatsapp Database files, and turns them into JSON objects.
To turn your `*.db.crypt` files into a `*.db` file (required), you can use a guide such as http://www.digitalinternals.com/security/decrypt-whatsapp-crypt8-database-messages/419/ (guide for the current standard, `*.crypt8`).
